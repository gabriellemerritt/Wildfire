\begin{abstract} 
Our project aims to create a learning algorithm that can predict the likelihood, location, and severity of wildfires in the state of California. On average, the state of California loses over 100 million dollars and 218,000 acres\cite{calfire11} due to wildfire damages. Currently California only employs fire prevention methods such as restricting certain kinds of fuels, controlled fires, and fire education to curb the damage of wildfires; however, using machine learning to learn fire patterns can help fire departments properly allocate resources and take targeted measures to preventing large wildfires.

\section{Status Report}

Your final submission will consist of two deliverables:  (1) a final report, and (2) a set of summary slides.  Remember that late days cannot be used for
the final project submission.
